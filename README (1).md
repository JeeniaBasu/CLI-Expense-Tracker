#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/Eln-_1hOudI

## Overview
CLI Expense Tracker is a command-line application in C that allows users to record, store, retrieve, and analyze personal expenses. The project demonstrates strong foundational programming skills including modular design, file handling, and structured data management.

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to create a practical, real-world utility while applying key programming concepts from CS50x. Expense management is a common problem, and implementing it in C reinforced skills in input handling, file I/O, and program structure.

## Features
- Add, view, and delete expense records
- Search expenses by category
- Calculate total expenses
- Persistent storage using text files
- Modular, menu-driven CLI design

## Tech Stack
- C programming language
- File I/O with `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`
- Modular programming with functions and structures

## Workflow
1. Program displays a menu with options for expense management
2. Users add, view, search, or calculate expenses
3. All data is stored in a file to maintain persistence between sessions

## Challenges & Learning Outcomes
- Safely handled user input and file operations
- Designed modular, maintainable code
- Strengthened debugging and logical problem-solving skills
- Applied core CS50x concepts: control flow, data abstraction, and persistent storage

## Future Improvements
- Track expense dates and generate monthly summaries
- Export data to CSV for external analysis
- Enhanced input validation and error handling
- Optionally accept command-line arguments for advanced usage

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical application of C programming and core software engineering principles. It highlights modular design, file handling, and structured data management — skills directly relevant to backend development roles.
